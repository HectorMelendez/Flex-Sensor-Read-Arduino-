Arduino Flex Sensor Read

This is not created by me.  I read this code a long time ago from a friend, now I would like to share it again.  
Please, donâ€™t make any profit from this work; it might be someone else hard work.

The code read the value (voltage) from the Flex Sensor connected to the Arduino.  
It have a conversion from the value to an actual digital value presented in the 
Serial Monitor from the Arduino application.
